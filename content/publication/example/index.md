abstract: Phonon polaritons in polar van der Waals materials enable strong
  electromagnetic-field confinement and enhancement for deeply subwavelength
  scale light-matter interactions. Here we propose and theoretically study
  acoustic phonon polaritons (APhPs) supported by a monolayer of hexagonal boron
  nitride (hBN) located at a few nanometers distance above a metal substrate.
  Compared to conventional hBN phonon polaritons, APhPs exhibit much larger
  polariton confinement, stronger near-field enhancement, and slower group
  velocity, altogether with nearly identical polariton lifetimes. These
  remarkable properties allow APhP-based nanoresonators to significantly enhance
  vibrational fingerprints of subnanometer-thick molecule layers, achieving
  strong coupling between molecular vibrations and APhP modes. Our work
  demonstrates the great potential of APhPs for exploring strong light–matter
  interactions at an extremely deep subwavelength-scale.
